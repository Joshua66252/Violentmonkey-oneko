# Spicetify Oneko

## This is a fork of [oneko.js](https://github.com/adryd325/oneko.js), and [Spicetify oneko](https://github.com/kyrie25/spicetify-oneko/) I did not make this, all credit goes to the creators.

cat follow mouse real.

oneko with additional features made for spicetify, now ported as a userscript for violent monkey.

right click the cat to open and close a variant selector menu, these save.

Planned/Todo
A way to hide and unhide the cat
The cat should run off and back on screen when either hidden or unhidden as well as when it is changing variants
